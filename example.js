// This module allows you to manage a collection of links across Markdown files; itâ€™s useful for use cases where you need to reference the same source several times across multiple sections of your documentation.  Given the following markdown:
console.log('markdown', 'remark-bookmarks is on [npm]!')

// And we require dependencies:
const remark = require('remark')
const remarkBookmarks = require('.')

// We can call remark-bookmarks to provide the missing reference:
const output = remark()
  .use(remarkBookmarks, {
    bookmarks: {
      github: 'https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-bookmarks',
      npm: 'https://npmjs.com/package/remark-bookmarks'
    }
  })
  .processSync('remark-bookmarks is on [npm]!')
  .toString()

// The output of this transform is below.
// Note that only the npm link is inserted into this document, to avoid unnecessary references.
console.log('markdown', output)
